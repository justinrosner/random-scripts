# random-scripts
This repo contains a collection of random scripts that I find useful

* ledger-graphs.py: Simple python script that allows for graphical visualization of ledger-cli balances
* prices.py: Python script that gets commodity prices from Yahoo Finance and updates a prices.db file that is used by ledger-cli
